       <h1> What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
<p>In today's world, technology is growing very fast, and we are getting in touch with different new technologies day by day.</p>
<p>Here, one of the booming technologies of computer science is Artificial Intelligence which is ready to create a new revolution in the world by making intelligent machines. The Artificial Intelligence is now all around us. It is currently working with a variety of subfields, ranging from general to specific, such as self-driving cars, playing chess, proving theorems, playing music, Painting, etc.</p>
<p>AI is one of the fascinating and universal fields of Computer science which has a great scope in future. AI holds a tendency to cause a machine to work as a human.
Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking power."
</p>
<p>So, we can define AI as:
 "It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions." 
Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human based skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems
With Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with own intelligence, and that is the awesomeness of AI.
It is believed that AI is not a new technology, and some people says that as per Greek myth, there were Mechanical men in early days which can work and behave like humans.
</p>
<h2>Why Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
<p>Before Learning about Artificial Intelligence, we should know that what is the importance of AI and why should we learn it. Following are some main reasons to learn about AI:</p>
<ul>
    <li>With the help of AI, you can create such software or devices which can solve real-world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc.</li>
    <li>With the help of AI, you can create your personal virtual Assistant, such as Cortana, Google Assistant, Siri, etc.</li>
    <li>With the help of AI, you can build such Robots which can work in an environment where survival of humans can be at risk.</li>
    <li>AI opens a path for other new technologies, new devices, and new Opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Following are the main goals of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Replicate human intelligence</li>
    <li>Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks</li>
    <li>An intelligent connection of perception and action</li>
    <li>Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Proving a theorem</li>
            <li>Playing chess</li>
            <li>Playing chess</li>
            <li>Driving a car in traffic</li>
        </ul>
</ol>
